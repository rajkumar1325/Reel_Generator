DAY 1:
    The foundation...
    🎯 Goal:
✅ Freeze the exact idea & features.
✅ Write the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) document.
✅ Pick Tech Stack — tools, APIs, hosting — NO CODING today.

            ✅ Task 1: What are you building? (Clarity)
            ✅ Task 2: Choose Tech Stack
            ✅ Task 3: Make “MVP Doc” (Project Document)
            ✅ Task 4: Decide Backend: Python (Flask) or Node.js (Express)?




DAY 2:
        🚀 DAY 2 PLAN — “Frontend (User Interface)”

🎯 Goal:
👉 Build a simple webpage:
1 text box (for user prompt)
1 "Generate Reel" button
(Later: this button will call your Flask backend)

            ✅ Task 1: Frontend Folder Setup
            ✅ Task 2: Write Code — Clean & Simple
            ✅ Task 3: Run it Locally:




DAY 3
        🚀 DAY 3 PLAN — "Flask Backend (Starter)"

🎯 Goal:
✔️ Setup Flask backend
✔️ Create API /generate to receive text prompt from frontend
✔️ For now: just print the prompt and return a dummy response — NO real AI or video yet (that’s Day 4+).


        ✅ Task 1: Install Flask (1 time setup)
        ✅ Task 2: Write Flask Backend — Simple Version
        ✅ Task 3: Connect Frontend to Flask Backend
        ✅ Task 4: Run & Test (Run app.py)

✅ Day 3 Checklist:
 Flask Installed
 Flask API (/generate) working
 Frontend fetch connected
 Tested end-to-end


DAY 4
        🚀 DAY 4 PLAN — "AI (GPT) Script Generation"
🎯 Goal:
✔️ Take user prompt from Frontend
✔️ Send it to OpenAI GPT (your free API key)
✔️ Get back a Reel script (text)
✔️ Return that to the Frontend

        ✅ Task 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key
        ✅ Task 2: Install OpenAI Python Package
        ✅ Task 3: Modify app.py — Add GPT Integration
        ✅ Task 4: Modify Frontend (script.js) to show AI script:
        ✅ Task 5: Test Now:
